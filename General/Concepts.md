## Symlinks: File System Shortcuts

**What are they?**

Symlinks (symbolic links) are like shortcuts for your files. They point to the location of another file, letting you access it from different places without copying it.

**Benefits:**

* **Organization:** Keep files organized in one place, access them from anywhere with symlinks.
* **Flexibility:** Move the original file? No worries, the symlink adjusts as long as the relative location is correct.
* **Version Control:** Developers use symlinks to link code to specific versions.
* **Space Savers:** Symlinks themselves are tiny, saving storage space.

**Code Snippet (Linux/macOS):**

```
ln -s target_file_path symlink_name
```

**Example:**

```
ln -s /home/user/documents/report.pdf /home/user/desktop/report_shortcut
```

This creates a symlink named "report_shortcut" on your desktop that points to the actual "report.pdf" file in your documents folder.
